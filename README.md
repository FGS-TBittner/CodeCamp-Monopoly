Monopoly is an exercise in living with your decisions.  That means that the most critical constraint of Monopoly is **NOT READING AHEAD**.  While the exercise here is written in releases which are somewhat larger than we'd ordinarily like larger, less frequent releases are less disruptive to our primary development effort.  Model distinct "features" as commits and use pull-requests on a per-release basis.
